# Hoya


Hoya is a YARN application to deploy existing distributed applications on YARN, 
monitor them and make them larger or smaller as desired -even while 
the cluster is running.


Hoya has a plug-in *provider* architecture to support different applications,
and currently supports Apache HBase and Apache Accumulo.

Clusters can be stopped, "frozen" and restarted, "thawed" later; the distribution
of the deployed application across the YARN cluster is persisted -enabling
a best-effort placement close to the previous locations on a cluster thaw.
Applications which remember the previous placement of data (such as HBase)
can exhibit fast start-up times from this feature.

YARN itself monitors the health of 'YARN containers" hosting parts of 
the deployed application -it notifies the Hoya manager application of container
failure. Hoya then asks YARN for a new container, into which Hoya deploys
a replacement for the failed component. As a result, Hoya can keep the
size of managed applications consistent with the specified configuration, even
in the face of failures of servers in the cluster -as well as parts of the
application itself
